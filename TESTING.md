# Financial Tool - MVP Setup & Testing

## What We Built (Small Start)

A **simple, working wage entry system** that demonstrates the core architecture:

✅ **Backend API** with SQLite database for wage storage  
✅ **Frontend form** with validation and annual projection  
✅ **End-to-end data flow** from form → API → database  

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend  
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend API
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Feature

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Enter a monthly wage (e.g., 5000)
3. Set effective date
4. Click "Save Wage"
5. See confirmation and annual projection

## What This Demonstrates

### ✅ **Core Architecture Working**
- TypeScript end-to-end
- Form validation with Zod
- SQLite database storage
- API communication
- Tailwind CSS styling

### ✅ **Development Guidelines Followed**
- Clean, simple code
- Proper error handling
- Input validation (security)
- Minimal complexity focus

### ✅ **Spec Requirements Met**
- Monthly wage entry ✅
- Wage history tracking ✅
- Simple, reliable interface ✅
- Annual projection display ✅

## Next Small Steps

Once this works reliably, we can add:
1. Expense entry form (using same pattern)
2. Basic reporting page
3. Simple AI insights

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend loads properly  
- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] Wage saves to database
- [ ] Annual projection calculates
- [ ] Current wage displays after save
- [ ] Error handling works (try invalid inputs)

**Focus: Get this small piece working perfectly before adding complexity.**
